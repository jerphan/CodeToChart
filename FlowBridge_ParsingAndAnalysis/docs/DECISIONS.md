# Decisions

Entries D001–D016 are dated 2026-10-29; later entries carry their own dates. Required choices come from the supplied master prompt;
provisional choices are recommendations, not finalized integration agreements.

## D001 — in-memory analysis only (required)
Decision: no analysis database; full snapshot per request.
Rationale: current workflow is upload/analyze/view; saved workspaces are deferred.
Consequences: no shared mutable revision cache; serializable results remain extensible.
Alternative deferred: SQL-backed saved analyses and incremental parsing.

## D002 — source parsing without execution (required)
Decision: use standard-library ast on fileContent, never execute/import uploads.
Rationale: source is untrusted and static analysis does not require execution.
Consequences: runtime call targets may remain unresolved.
Alternative rejected: introspection through running uploaded modules.

## D003 — one canonical result (required)
Decision: derive FlowchartOutput and MappingOutput from ProjectAnalysis.
Rationale: Kevin and Grace must share IDs and source data.
Consequences: output adapters cannot independently regenerate IDs.
Alternative rejected: separate graph generation pipelines for each consumer.

## D004 — documentation-first empty baseline (observed)
Decision: create documentation only in the first task.
Rationale: explicit first-task instruction; workspace has no implementation or starter.
Consequences: there is nothing to rewrite or test as Python; starter conflicts are
unknown, not absent by proof. Alternative rejected: inventing starter capabilities.

## D005 — validation details (provisional)
Decision: use defaults specified in INPUT_OUTPUT_CONTRACT, preserving the required shape.
Rationale: precise validation needs rules for booleans, empty values and duplicates.
Consequences: test these rules before relying on them; discuss any input-shape change.
Alternatives: permissive coercion (risks identity changes), strict rejection of unknown
fields (reduces forward compatibility). Revision type/range still needs teammate confirmation.

## D006 — partial results and unsupported scopes (provisional)
Decision: isolate failures, report graph status, use empty non-executable graphs for
unsupported function scopes, and retain valid sibling results.
Rationale: avoid misleading flow while retaining navigation metadata.
Consequences: consumers must inspect status; diagnostics carry affected scope/graph.
Alternative: omit affected graphs entirely (requires nullable function graph links).

## D007 — stateless diagnostics API (provisional)
Decision: return diagnostics on results; defer no-argument collect_diagnostics().
Rationale: a last-result service cache risks cross-request/revision contamination.
Consequences: suggested API is not promised verbatim; settle before implementation.
Alternative: a request-scoped collector, if later integration requires it.

## D008 — bounded semantics (provisional)
Decision: function CFGs initially abstract expressions; file views are overviews,
not module runtime CFGs. Implement conservative try/except and bounded import
resolution only in later tested phases.
Rationale: complete Python semantics exceed the current capstone scope.
Consequences: explicitly diagnose unsupported constructs and explain approximation.
Alternative: broad silent best-effort modeling (rejected for misleading graphs).

## D009 — starter as inspiration and modular scaffold (user requested)
Decision: retain the supplied starter under reference/flowbridge_starter; create
the requested src, tests and examples structure in the existing workspace root.
Rationale: the user explicitly requested inspiration rather than adopting the ZIP.
Consequences: archive instructions are reference content, module files are clearly
unimplemented, and starter outputs are not golden fixtures. Bytecode is omitted.
Alternative rejected: copying the monolithic starter into the active package.
This local reference extraction does not add ZIP intake to the analysis module.

## Open design items (remaining)
Single-file API, resource limits, path normalization,
module/package ambiguity handling, and exact exception subset need review when
their phases begin. No finalized input contract change has been made.

## D010 — model foundation (2026-10-29, current task)
Decision: implement documented validation defaults and typed records without
changing JSON keys. FileInput holds source; FileMetadata names the documented
FileInfo output record. ValidationResult returns a complete input or diagnostics;
direct model misuse raises ValueError (TypeError for missing constructor fields).
Rationale: explicit request for typed models and validation, without AST parsing.
Consequences: models do not imply working analysis or downstream projections.
Unknown extension fields must contain JSON data before being ignored. These
implemented defaults do not claim external teammate sign-off.
Alternatives: untyped dictionaries or an external framework were not needed.

## D011 — deterministic IDs (2026-10-29, current task)
Decision: URL-safe base64 encoding of versioned JSON tuples containing project,
revision, kind and structural key; sorted JSON keys for deterministic serialization.
Rationale: no shared counters or ambiguous delimiters; no hash collisions.
Consequences: callers must choose unique structural keys; IDs may be long, are
not secret and change with revision. Supplied project/file IDs remain intact.
Alternative: hashing is shorter but introduces theoretical collision risk.

## D012 — working rules (2026-10-29, current task)
Decision: adopt the user's twelve mandatory rules in AGENTS.md, including exact
precedence, required reads, evidence, documentation and final reporting.
Rationale: the obsolete first-task documentation-only restriction conflicts with
the current implementation request; it was explicitly removed.
Consequences: no approved architecture was silently replaced. Future tasks use
PROGRESS for actual status rather than relying on conversation history.

## D013 — parsing versus feature support (2026-10-29, current task)
Decision: parse with ast.parse only, return a separate internal ParseResult, and
inspect accepted ASTs with FeatureValidator in validator.py. Initial statements
are direct FunctionDef plus Assign, Expr, If and Return in function bodies.
Nested conditionals are accepted; nested functions and module execution remain
unsupported per the existing scoped design. A leading module docstring is metadata.
Rationale: the user requests syntax/feature separation and an explicit small subset.
Consequences: loops and try/except are parseable but unsupported, and no graphs
are generated. Expression children and signatures are inspected with an allowlist;
unsupported subtrees are reported once, with other branches still checked.
Alternative rejected: treating every successfully parsed AST as fully supported.

## D014 — diagnostic spans and parser limits (2026-10-29, current task)
Decision: copy AST byte offsets; normalize SyntaxError character offsets using
the original line prefix's UTF-8 length. Preserve point spans and return null
when no reliable start is available. Encoding and recursion failures have separate
codes and undetermined syntax_valid rather than being mislabeled syntax errors.
Rationale: frontend source coordinates must be consistent without invented ranges.
Consequences: ast.parse acceptance does not promise complete compiler context checks
or runtime validity; resource limits/process isolation remain a future task.
Alternative rejected: executing or dynamically importing uploaded code to validate it.

## D015 — lexical metadata without CFGs (2026-10-29, current task)
Decision: ASTAnalyzer consumes the parsed AST, exact FileInput and RevisionIds;
returns a file-local ASTAnalysis with FunctionInfo, SymbolTable and unresolved
CallSite records. Reuse existing FunctionInfo/SymbolInfo downstream shapes.
Rationale: explicit request for metadata, lexical bindings and calls without CFGs.
Consequences: graph IDs are reserved only; no graph references or ProjectAnalysis
are generated yet. Header defaults/decorators belong to the defining module scope;
annotation text is retained without asserting evaluation or annotation call sites.
Alternative rejected: walking all AST nodes without scope boundaries, which would
attribute nested declarations and header calls to the wrong function.

## D016 — conservative binding lookup (2026-10-29, current task)
Decision: retain every occurrence per scope/name and return nearest lexical groups,
not runtime targets. Nested/conditional/async/class declarations bind a name but
omit inner metadata/bodies. Unsupported subtrees mark extraction incomplete;
global/nonlocal causes the owning function body to be omitted. Do not fall back
through incomplete scopes. Imports are informational, never dynamically imported.
Rationale: avoid scope leakage and false name-only call resolution while implementing
the requested initial symbol table. Local assignments shadow parents regardless
of their execution order, but no initialization or reachability is inferred.
Consequences: conservative omissions can suppress valid outer-name candidates;
closures, definite assignment and full Python resolution remain future work.
Alternative rejected: silently choosing the last binding or a matching project name.

## D017 — class-aligned files (2026-11-03, user requested)
Decision: PascalCase component files; individual serializable model files with
package re-exports; retain existing class names and JSON contracts. Move feature
inspection to FeatureValidator.py, retaining function-only JSON validation in
validator.py. Legacy component paths alias canonical modules.
Rationale: align navigation with the supplied UML filename list without redesign.
Alternatives: rename classes to diagram terminology or introduce empty output
classes (rejected); remove old import paths (rejected to preserve public APIs).
Consequences: model dependency imports are explicit and acyclic; no duplicated
implementations. Scaffolds remain unimplemented. Complete mapping is recorded in
FILE_ORGANIZATION.md; actual UML images were not available in this task.

## D018 — input-validation class and preserved ID format (2026-11-03)
Decision: rename validator.py to InputValidator.py and expose stateless
InputValidator.validate(payload). Keep validate_project as the single existing
validation implementation and preserve old module imports through an alias.
Rationale: explicit Phase 1 request and class-aligned navigation, without behavior
or JSON changes. Input validation never parses source; PythonParser owns syntax.
Alternative: duplicate/rewrite validation inside the class (rejected as unnecessary).
RevisionIds retains fb1_ JSON/base64 encoding; clearer scope documentation and tests
are sufficient. Random IDs or a new encoding would break determinism/compatibility.
Consequences: same supplied identifiers, same diagnostics and generated IDs;
callers remain responsible for unique structural keys within each owning context.

## D019 — Phase 2 graph fields and model integrity (2026-11-03)
Decision: honor the user's explicit graphType and optional edge label requirements:
GraphModel stores graph_type and serializes graphType; FlowEdge stores nullable
label. Preserve view_type as a Python constructor/property alias with conflict
checks. Retain file/function owners, graph status, enum values and ID encoding.
Rationale: the new explicit request takes precedence over the prior viewType JSON
spelling. This output change was explained before implementation; it does not
change the input contract. Exact UML images remain unavailable.
Alternatives: silently retaining viewType would miss the request; emitting both
JSON keys adds redundant contract state; breaking all Python callers unnecessarily
would require unrelated CFG edits. These alternatives were rejected.
Consequences: existing JSON consumers must migrate to graphType. Python callers
remain compatible. dataclasses.replace should use canonical graph_type when changing
the graph kind. Nested records are revalidated, references use graph-local tuple
keys, duplicate mappings and inconsistent call ownership are rejected. No parsing,
CFG construction, output adapter or new supporting relationship schema was added.

## D020 — parsing identity and bounded loop metadata (2026-11-03)
Decision: ParseResult carries file_id for successful, empty and failed parses;
this optional trailing Python-only field preserves earlier constructor calls.
FeatureValidator uses named traversal context rather than six-position tuples,
without changing its allowlist or conservative exception semantics.
ASTAnalyzer visits ordinary for/while targets, tests and bodies in their existing
scope, including calls and assignments, and treats break/continue as nonbinding.
Loop-else and try binding subtrees remain omitted with INCOMPLETE_SCOPE. Nested
functions/classes/expression scopes remain isolated. Symbol lookup detects cycles
in externally mutated parent chains instead of looping forever.
Rationale: the user's Phases 3/4 require identity-preserving results and useful local
bindings/calls. Python loops do not introduce a new scope. Lexical occurrence does
not imply execution or definite assignment, even for while False.
Alternatives: treating every loop as incomplete loses supported metadata; inferring
runtime reachability or implementing nested scopes exceeds this bounded phase.
Consequences: loop bindings can now shadow outer names; source/ID/JSON contracts and
CFG algorithms are unchanged. Full Python scope/compiler semantics remain unclaimed.
This refines D016's earlier conservative omission of all loop subtrees.

## D021 — loop-else distinguishes exhaustion and break (2026-11-03)
Decision: implement loop-else as explicitly requested in Phase 5B. Only the loop
header's false/exhaustion path enters else; saved break paths bypass it. Pop the
loop body context before building else. Feature validation mirrors this context
boundary, allowing inner-else controls only when an outer loop body exists.
Rationale: Python's else means normal completion, not a common destination for all
loop exits. A separate list of break exits already provides the required distinction.
Alternatives: route break through else (incorrect), or keep rejecting all loop-else
(unnecessary now that distinct completion paths are tested).
Consequences: existing source without loop-else keeps its topology/ID conventions;
else statements gain normal source mappings. Return/exception paths bypass else.
No input/output schema changes. ASTAnalyzer loop-else extraction remains a separate
incomplete milestone; async iteration and full exception/finally handling remain
unsupported. This supersedes the original loop-else deferral for CFGs only.

## D022 — bounded call relationships (2026-11-03)
Decision: implement requested call resolution ahead of service assembly. Preserve
CallReference/callReferences as the canonical public contract; CallRelationship
is a Python alias. Add internal ImportRelationship metadata rather than inventing
new downstream fields. Resolve lexical declarations and explicit absolute module
imports using root-relative snapshot paths. Reject uncertain scope/import patterns.
Rationale: distinguish module imports from member imports without source execution
or ambiguous flattened importTarget interpretation. Alternatives rejected: searching
the entire project by function name, runtime importing, or changing public JSON.
Consequences: graph IDs remain reserved until assembly; runtime monkey-patching,
relative/local imports and re-exports remain outside the subset. Full UML images
remain unavailable; the existing approved contract controls public field names.

## D023 — hierarchy and approved projection extension (2026-11-03)
Decision: implement structural project/file views and request-local service assembly.
Project/file graphs contain navigation nodes without execution edges (D008). Failed
parses retain empty failed file graphs; unsupported module execution retains a
complete structural overview and unsupported FileMetadata status. Unsupported
function CFGs remain empty but navigable. Empty valid projects succeed.
Rationale: preserve useful sibling views without asserting module execution flow.
Alternative rejected: connecting independent functions with ordinary CFG edges.

The user explicitly approved adding files, functions, callReferences and symbols
(including import bindings) to FlowchartOutput. This gives Kevin labels/ownership,
call targets and import metadata alongside graphs. MappingOutput already contains
graphReferences and callReferences; its fields remain unchanged. The UML role
CallRelationship remains the alias of CallReference; no callRelationships rename or
new public importRelationships array is introduced. Exact UML images remain absent.
Alternative rejected: silently adding duplicate relationship fields. Both outputs
are immutable-at-capture JSON snapshots of one validated ProjectAnalysis; no new
IDs, persistence or independently built graphs are introduced by projections.

## D024 — final review corrections and revision lifecycle (2026-11-03)
Decision: retain full-snapshot stateless reanalysis and compatibility for both
ProjectGraphs/ProjectGraphResult names and list/dictionary function-graph inputs.
Reject invalid duplicate parameters before executable CFG construction; return
structured null-filename diagnostics; tolerate root-only metadata paths without
filesystem operations. Strict JSON failure-envelope decoding preserves valid
revision identity consistently for text/dictionary inputs.
Rationale: observed import failures and input-triggered defects, verified with
regression tests. Alternatives rejected: reusing previous valid graphs on syntax
failure, broad exception suppression, silently changing consumer schema or input
path requirements. Consequence: latest-response selection stays with the UI;
callers must issue distinct revision IDs for changed text. Full compiler/resource
validation remains explicitly incomplete. No public schema changes in this task.

## D025 — Code Manager input adapter (user approved)
Decision: accept projectID/fileID through CodeManagerInputAdapter.normalize and
translate to existing canonical names, adding the caller-supplied revision_id.
Rationale: actual Code Manager output has uppercase ID keys and no revision field.
Preserve backend/consumer contracts and source text. Reject alias/revision conflicts.
Alternative rejected: implicit adapter counters/default revision 1, which would
misidentify snapshots across workers or restarts. The backend owns revision ordering;
the local example runner exposes --revision-id. No database or cached results added.

## D026 — absolute imports are supported metadata
User clarified that supported imports must participate in symbol-based call
resolution without unsupported-feature errors. Accept direct absolute imports in
FeatureValidator while retaining structural file views. Previously the blanket
module-execution rejection contradicted the supported call-resolution subset.
No public schema change or runtime importing. Relative/star/future/conditional/local
import forms retain explicit restrictions. Missing targets remain nonresolved.
