# Progress

## Actual implementation status
Phases 1–3 foundations/metadata, phase 4 sequence/branch CFGs, phase 5 loop CFGs
and the bounded phase 9 try/except CFG subset are implemented. Phase 9's graph
algorithm was implemented ahead of overview/service integration at the user's
explicit request. Bounded call resolution is also implemented. Hierarchy, service and consumer projections are implemented. The complete suite passes 219 tests on Python 3.12.14.

The preceding CFG task changed CFGBuilder.py, FeatureValidator and package exports; added
33 CFG tests and updated earlier feature/integration tests for the expanded subset.
- CFGBuilder builds function GraphModel, FlowNodes, FlowEdges and SourceMappings.
- Sequences, Assign/Expr/Pass, if/elif/else and return use pending normal predecessors.
- For/while use nearest-loop contexts; back, exit, break and continue paths are explicit.
- For iterator setup is separate from repeated advancement. Literal boolean while
  conditions avoid impossible false/true paths.
- Basic try/except preserves normal bypass, ordered possible matching, exceptional
  exits and terminal returns. Return-expression evaluation can fail separately.
- Unsupported functions return empty unsupported graphs; unreachable statements
  are diagnosed/omitted. IDs agree with ASTAnalyzer and are revision-scoped.
- Source-backed nodes receive AST locations immediately; synthetic nodes are unmapped.

No uploaded code is executed. Input JSON and enums are unchanged. Phase 2 intentionally changes graph JSON
viewType to graphType and adds nullable edge label (D019).
CFG_DESIGN.md explains the predecessor strategy, supported subset and approximations.

## Verification
Incremental full-suite runs: 90 passed for sequences/branches, 99 passed for loops,
and 113 passed for exceptions/integration. One intermediate exception test assumed
an unsupported error was always the first diagnostic; it now checks for the error
alongside the new conservative-exception warning. Final run: zero failures/errors.
See TESTING.md for the command and coverage.

## Remaining limitations
ASTAnalyzer extracts ordinary for/while bindings and calls; try and loop-else
binding subtrees remain incomplete. CFG support is still broader for try. Exceptions are conservative
may-flow, not inferred runtime types. No nested try, aliases, finally, try/else,
try-star or explicit raise. Loop-else CFGs are supported; lexical extraction
for loop-else remains incomplete. Expression-level short-circuit paths are
atomic. Implicit exceptions are expanded only for functions containing try.
Compiler-context validation, resource isolation and full source-bound checks remain
incomplete. Starter code/tests remain reference-only.

## Next recommended task
Harden compiler-context and resource validation, then verify consumer integration.
Preserve incomplete lexical-analysis diagnostics for try and loop-else subtrees.

## History
Documentation and scaffold setup preceded model/input validation, parsing/feature
inspection and conservative AST metadata/symbol tables. This task implements CFGs
in three tested stages; it does not implement the remaining service or teammate modules.

## Latest task — file organization, 2026-11-03
Renamed component files to PascalCase, extracted all 15 existing model classes,
and separated feature validation from JSON input validation. Kept package exports
and legacy component imports compatible. Moved the output scaffold into outputs/.
No new algorithms, classes, output adapters or contracts were introduced.
Baseline: 113 tests passed. After refactoring: 117 tests passed, including four
new import/identity checks. Full inventory and differences: FILE_ORGANIZATION.md.
UML images were unavailable; the attached explicit filename list guided the work.

## Working standards update — 2026-11-03
Saved the user's undergraduate-friendly coding, commenting, testing and reporting
standards in AGENTS.md. RevisionIds and input validation remain required supporting
components. The user's InputValidator name currently corresponds to the
validate_project function in validator.py; no class was added or renamed.
Documentation-only change: no algorithms, contracts or implementation status changed.
Tests were not rerun for this update; the latest executed suite remains 117 passing.
Next implementation phase remains phase 6 overview graphs and canonical outputs.

## Phase 0 audit — 2026-11-03
Read-only application audit completed; baseline full suite: 117 passed.
See ARCHITECTURE_AUDIT.md for each class, gaps, dependencies and test assessment.
Project service, overview builder, resolver and output adapters are missing.
InputValidator naming/API is the smallest immediate task; after authorized Phase 1,
implement the overview builder alone before broader integration. Exact UML image
comparison remains unavailable. No application code changed during Phase 0.

## Phase 1 complete — 2026-11-03
Renamed validator.py to InputValidator.py; added stateless InputValidator.validate
backed by unchanged validate_project behavior. Updated exports and retained legacy
imports. RevisionIds' algorithm/format is unchanged; expanded purpose/scope
explanations and tests. No parsing in input validation and no public JSON changes.
Existing 15 validation cases now exercise the class; ten new boundary/ID tests
bring the suite to 127 passing tests. See TESTING.md for commands and outcomes.
The Phase 0 audit is preserved as a pre-change snapshot in ARCHITECTURE_AUDIT.md.
Its naming/API gap is now resolved; other gaps remain. Exact UML diagrams are still
unavailable. Smallest next implementation: ProjectGraphBuilder alone (phase 6a).

## Requested Phase 2 complete — 2026-11-03
Inspected all nine core models and existing supporting records. Added canonical
graph_type/graphType with legacy Python view_type compatibility, and nullable edge
label. Hardened nested record validation/JSON serialization; ProjectAnalysis now
indexes graph-local nodes, rejects duplicate mappings and validates call ownership.
No parsing or CFG algorithm changes. Exact UML image comparison remains unavailable.
Twelve new behavior tests pass; 26 focused model tests and 139 full-suite tests pass.
Full source bounds, scope integrity and mapping completeness remain integration
work. Service, overviews, call resolution and output adapters are still missing.
Next smallest task remains ProjectGraphBuilder overviews/navigation (original 6a).

## Requested Phases 3 and 4 complete for the bounded subset — 2026-11-03
Existing parsing, feature inspection and core function/symbol extraction already
met most requested behavior. Added ParseResult.file_id, named feature traversal
context, ordinary loop binding/call extraction and symbol-parent-cycle protection.
Preserved nested-scope isolation and conservative try diagnostics; try metadata
extraction remains incomplete. No CFG algorithms or public JSON shapes changed.
Twelve new tests bring the full suite to 151 passing tests. One old test was updated
from omitted loop bindings to extracted loop bindings while retaining checks that
lambda/comprehension scopes stay isolated. Exact calculator metadata and lookup
are tested and documented in AST_ANALYSIS.md. Exact UML images remain unavailable.
Next task remains ProjectGraphBuilder overviews/navigation, followed by service and
output integration; complete scope/resource/compiler handling is not claimed.

## Requested Phase 5A complete — 2026-11-03
Sequence/if/elif/nested branches/return behavior was already implemented. Extracted
focused build_if/build_return helpers with branch-merge and terminal-path comments;
block remains the sequence helper. No ID, schema, loop or exception behavior changed.
Seven new exact-connectivity tests cover implicit End, if/else merge, missing else,
pass else, repeated-label nested branches, elif/multiple returns/unreachable source,
and bare return. Focused CFG suite: 40 passed. Full suite: 158 passed.
No failures in this task. Existing location/ID/revision and loop/exception tests
also pass. See CFG_DESIGN.md for the step-by-step if/else example.
Next: ProjectGraphBuilder overviews/navigation; if following the user's phase
sequence, verify existing loop semantics separately in Phase 5B without rebuilding
the already-tested sequence/branch implementation.

## Requested Phase 5B complete — 2026-11-03
Added loop-else CFGs, routing normal exhaustion through else and break around it.
Preserved existing while/for/nested loop headers/back edges and Phase 5A behavior.
Extracted build_loop_control and documented nearest-context ownership; popped loop
context before else so inner-else controls correctly target an outer loop body.
FeatureValidator now distinguishes body and else loop depth. Invalid controls and
other unsupported constructs still yield empty unsupported graphs with diagnostics.
Added 12 loop tests; focused CFG suite: 52 pass; full suite: 170 pass. No failures.
Existing loop-else rejection expectations were replaced with positive connectivity
coverage; outside-loop controls remain rejected. Lexical extraction of loop-else
and try remains incomplete and explicitly diagnosed by ASTAnalyzer.
Next missing implementation: ProjectGraphBuilder overviews/navigation (original 6a).

## Requested Phases 5C/6 — 2026-11-03
Verified existing exception subset and added exact topology/rejection regressions.
Implemented CallResolver, internal ImportRelationship extraction in ASTAnalyzer,
and CallRelationship alias of canonical CallReference. Same-file lexical calls,
recursion, forward declarations and explicit absolute imports/aliases resolve;
ambiguous, builtin, external and unresolved results retain reasons and locations.
No public input/output schema changes. See CALL_RESOLUTION.md for exact boundaries.
Executed full unittest discovery: 183 tests passed, zero failures/errors.
No service/overview/output adapters added. Next: ProjectGraphBuilder, then service
assembly with target-graph integrity checks and retained partial-scope diagnostics.


## Phases 7/8 complete — 2026-11-03
Implemented ProjectGraphBuilder, ParsingAnalysisService, FlowchartOutput and
MappingOutput. Added 11 pipeline/hierarchy tests. Full suite: 194 passed, zero
failures/errors. Generated and JSON-round-trip-verified calculator and multi-file
outputs for Kevin/Grace. Calculator: success, 4 graphs, 3 navigation references.
Multi-file imports: partial (unsupported module execution), 5 graphs, 4 references;
its supported imported function call resolves to the existing function CFG.
Approved Kevin metadata additions are recorded in D023; Grace's schema is unchanged.
No source execution, persistence or UI added. Module runtime CFGs, try/loop-else
lexical completeness, full Python resolution, resource limits and editor conversion
remain outside the implemented subset. Next: strengthen compiler-context/resource
validation and consumer integration before exposing uploads to untrusted users.


## Phases 9/10 complete — 2026-11-03
Full-snapshot editing was already stateless; added lifecycle comments and 13 tests
covering edited conditions, added/removed functions, line shifts/UTF-8 mappings,
syntax failure/recovery, failed import targets, deterministic independent results,
project/revision isolation, repeated/older revisions and final-review regressions.
Fixed hierarchy API/import breakage, pathological path crashes, duplicate-parameter
CFG acceptance and valid identity loss in structurally invalid JSON text.
No approved public schema changed. FINAL_REVIEW.md records all findings and failures.
Final run: 207 tests passed. Generated/round-trip checked six consumer JSON fixtures.
INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md documents Justin/Kevin/Grace invocation and revision rejection.
Ready for controlled team integration; resource isolation, full compiler semantics,
complete try/loop-else symbols and live consumer verification remain outstanding.

## VS Code manual examples — 2026-11-03
Added examples/run_analysis.py and six JSON snapshots under examples/manual_inputs/.
The runner exports canonical/Kevin/Grace JSON to examples/results/<input-stem>/ and
prints diagnostics. Application contracts/algorithms are unchanged. All six cases
plus orders_input.json ran successfully with expected success/partial statuses.
See VSCODE_TESTING.md for commands, output paths and unsupported-syntax behavior.

## Code Manager adapter complete
Added src/flowbridge_analysis/CodeManagerInputAdapter.py, package export, explicit
--revision-id runner option, actual three-file sample and eight adapter tests.
External uppercase ID fields now normalize without changing values/source/paths;
caller supplies revision, no counter/cache. Full suite: 215 passed, zero failures.
CLI sample: success/revision 1/3 files/3 functions/7 graphs. Updated input contract,
architecture, decisions, integration guide and VS Code instructions. Next integration
step: backend coordinator supplies request revisions and handles adapter ValueError.


## Import feature-validation consistency correction
FeatureValidator now accepts direct absolute imports as metadata, matching the
implemented resolver subset. Unsupported import forms retain errors; no runtime
import execution or new CFG edges were added. Four new regression tests verify
aliases, cross-file target integrity, unsupported forms and external calls.
Adapter tests now own their fixture instead of depending on editable manual JSON.
Full suite: 219 passed. User's current five-file code_manager_input.json rerun at
revision 2: success, 5 files, 10 functions, 16 graphs, no diagnostics printed.
Generated consumer fixtures refreshed; module-initialization semantics remain unmodeled.
