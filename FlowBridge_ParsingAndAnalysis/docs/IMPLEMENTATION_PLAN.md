# Phased implementation plan

Current status: bounded phases 1–9 are integrated; full-snapshot reanalysis and
final review pass 207 tests. Original numbering below differs from the later
user phase sequence. Remaining hardening: resource/process limits, complete
compiler checks, omitted lexical subtrees and consumer integration. Dated
milestone sections preserve historical evidence. See FINAL_REVIEW.md.

## Original Phase 0 — documentation baseline (historical, complete)
Acceptance: inspect available files; create AGENTS plus all ten required docs;
record missing starter code, requirements, proposed defaults and implementation
gaps; recommend a next task and stop. No Python rewrite or feature implementation.

## Phase 1 — input validation and package foundation (complete)
Depends on phase 0. Add pyproject.toml (Python >=3.12), src package, input/diagnostic
dataclasses, and JSON validation only. Confirm provisional validation defaults
against the unchanged required shape before implementation.
Acceptance: supplied example validates and preserves IDs; missing fields, wrong
types, bool revision, malformed JSON and duplicate file IDs yield structured
diagnostics; empty files/projects behave as documented; JSON roundtrip succeeds.
Use unittest, with no third-party runtime dependency. Do not add CFG stubs presented
as working features. Deliver tests and exact execution results.

## Phase 2 — parser and feature diagnostics (complete for initial subset)
Depends on phase 1. Add PythonParser and FeatureValidator, plus isolated file results.
Acceptance: valid/empty source parses; syntax errors and invalid edits do not crash;
one bad file does not suppress valid siblings; unsupported scopes are identified;
source text is never executed/imported. Normalize and test diagnostic locations.

## Phase 3 — metadata and lexical symbols (complete for documented subset)
Depends on phase 2. Extract functions, qualified names, all parameter kinds, spans,
scope IDs, local bindings and import bindings. Record module-level code explicitly.
Acceptance: zero/multiple parameters, duplicate definitions, shadowed names,
Unicode spans, and module/function scope separation have tests. Nested functions
and classes remain explicitly unsupported until designed.

## Phase 4 — sequential and branching CFGs (complete)
Depends on phase 3. Implement statements, Start/End, if/elif/else and return.
Acceptance: deterministic IDs, nested merges, early returns and unreachable code
tests pass; no edge leaves a return toward a following statement; all endpoints
exist; every source-backed node has accurate mappings. Diagnose loops until phase 5.

## Phase 5 — loops (complete for documented subset)
Depends on phase 4. Implement for/while and nearest-context break/continue.
Acceptance: back/exit edges, zero-iteration paths, nested loops and early returns
pass dedicated tests. Loop-else exhaustion/break distinction is now implemented
and tested by requested Phase 5B; lexical loop-else extraction remains incomplete.

## Phase 6 — overview graphs and canonical outputs (implemented)
Depends on phase 4; integrate phase 5 when available. Add ProjectGraphBuilder,
orchestration around the existing ProjectAnalysis model, and the two output projections.
Acceptance: project/file/function views, status propagation, empty projects/files,
all reference/mapping integrity checks, JSON serialization, identical downstream
IDs, and fresh-state reanalysis tests pass. Finalize analyze_file/result diagnostics
interfaces before advertising them.

## Phase 7 — same-file call resolution (bounded subset implemented)
Depends on phases 3 and 6. Resolve only unshadowed, statically identifiable direct
calls; distinguish unresolved, ambiguous, builtin and external calls.
Acceptance: recursion, forward declarations, duplicate definitions, parameter/local
shadowing and module-level calls are tested; no name-only project-wide guessing.
Decorated/rebound functions are not resolved without explicit supporting analysis.

## Phase 8 — bounded cross-file resolution (implemented)
Depends on phase 7. Proposed initial subset: unique root-relative modules and
absolute `import module [as alias]` / `from module import name [as alias]` bindings.
No relative/star imports, dynamic imports, re-exports or runtime sys.path inference.
Acceptance: aliases resolve only through known unshadowed bindings; ambiguous
module paths and missing targets stay nonresolved; no user code is imported.
Document supported path conventions before enabling this subset.

## Phase 9 — basic try/except (bounded subset integrated)
Depends on phases 5 and 6. Implement the bounded CFG_DESIGN subset and label its
conservative semantics. Acceptance: normal bypass, possible handler entry,
unhandled exits, return-expression exceptions and handler errors have tests;
unsupported else/finally/nesting produce diagnostics, not incorrect sequential CFGs.

## Phase 10 — integration hardening
Depends on phases 6–9. Add representative examples and teammate-facing JSON fixtures.
Acceptance: complete TESTING matrix, determinism, mixed-file errors, two revisions,
no stale mappings, and projection integrity pass on Python 3.12+. Set and test
resource limits before exposure to untrusted uploads (limits are currently undecided).

## Deferred work
Saved workspaces, databases, incremental parsing, richer Python semantics, class/
nested-function support, full exception typing and stable IDs across edits.
The supplied starter has now been statically inspected; see reference/README.md
for reusable ideas and gaps. It is inspiration only, not the active implementation.

## Structural refactoring complete — 2026-11-03
PascalCase component files and individual model files now match existing class
names. No pipeline phase or algorithm was added. Output classes remain phase 6
work. All 113 prior tests plus four import/identity tests pass (117 total).
See FILE_ORGANIZATION.md for migration details.

## Audit-driven task order — 2026-11-03
Phase 0 audit complete (ARCHITECTURE_AUDIT.md); 117 baseline tests passed.
Current requested Phase 1: InputValidator module/class compatibility plus ID
verification and scope documentation. Existing validation/ID algorithms already work.
Then split original phase 6 into: (6a) ProjectGraphBuilder overviews/navigation,
(6b) request-local service assembly/status/integrity, (6c) output projections.
ProjectAnalysis is implemented as a record; FlowchartOutput and MappingOutput are
not implemented records or adapters. Original phases 7–10 remain pending except
for the bounded phase 9 function CFG algorithm already implemented.

## Requested Phase 1 verification complete — 2026-11-03
InputValidator class/module naming and compatibility are implemented; existing
structural rules remain unchanged. RevisionIds keeps its established format with
explicit uniqueness/ownership documentation and broader tests. Full suite: 127 pass.
Do not repeat already working validation or ID generation in the service.
Next bounded task: 6a ProjectGraphBuilder only. Accept existing file/function
metadata and function graph identities; build project/file overview nodes and
GraphReferences without execution edges. Test empty/multiple files, ownership,
unsupported targets and deterministic IDs. Service/status integration and adapters
remain separate follow-up tasks; preserve incomplete lexical-analysis diagnostics.

## Requested Phase 2 — UML data model completion (complete, 2026-11-03)
This is the user's new model-completion phase, distinct from original phase 2
parsing. All nine existing models inspected; graphType and edge label implemented,
nested validation and reference integrity strengthened, serialization tested.
Focused model suite: 26 pass; full suite: 139 pass. Exact diagram comparison remains
limited to the supplied class list/field requirements because images are absent.
Next: original phase 6a ProjectGraphBuilder only. Preserve D019's graphType contract;
retain source-bound/scope/mapping-completeness work in integration hardening.

## Requested Phases 3/4 — parser/features and metadata (2026-11-03)
Completed for the documented subset, building on original phases 2/3. ParseResult
now includes file identity; feature traversal is named and stateless; ordinary
loop bindings/calls are extracted. Nested functions remain explicitly unsupported
with body isolation. Basic try/except feature/CFG support already existed and stays
conservative; try binding extraction remains incomplete. No CFG work performed.
151 tests pass. Keep remaining service/overview/output milestones separate from
this completion; next bounded implementation remains original phase 6a.

## Requested Phase 5A verification complete — 2026-11-03
Existing sequence/branch/return construction now has focused helpers and seven
additional exact-connectivity tests. No new loop work; existing loop and exception
regressions pass. Original phase 6a remains the next missing implementation.

## Requested Phase 5B complete — 2026-11-03
while/for, nested contexts, back/normal exits, break/continue and early return are
verified, with loop-else now implemented. 52 CFG / 170 total tests pass. Phase 5A
behavior is preserved. Broader loop-else lexical extraction is separate from this
CFG milestone. Next missing component remains original phase 6a ProjectGraphBuilder.

## Requested Phase 6 completed — 2026-11-03
CallResolver now implements bounded same-file and absolute cross-file resolution,
ahead of original overview/service phases at the user's request. See
CALL_RESOLUTION.md; 183 tests pass including exception subset regressions.
Next missing component: ProjectGraphBuilder, followed by service/output assembly.

## Requested Phases 7/8 complete — 2026-11-03
Hierarchy, service assembly and both projections are implemented and tested (194
passing tests). Sample outputs are generated from the real pipeline. Remaining work:
compiler-context/resource hardening, complete omitted lexical subtrees, consumer
integration, and separately approved broader Python semantics. No module CFG or
public relationship-field renaming was introduced.

## Current completion
Requested editing/review phases are complete for the documented subset; 207 tests
pass. Use FINAL_REVIEW.md and INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md for remaining hardening and team
consumption. Earlier dated phase entries above are historical, not current blockers.
